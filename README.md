## heliopause for the love2d framework

To get up and running on an android device:

1. Install termux and love2d:

   - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux
   - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.love2d.android

2. Run `termux_setup.sh` to install the development dependencies.

3. Run `rake` to create the `heliopause.love` zip file. Android will ask which
